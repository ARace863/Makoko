      <h2>If Makoko wasn't a slum of hope, many people would just be living for the next day, but residents of
        Makoko are trying to escape their current life. The government of Nigeria would prefer that Makoko
        didn't exist as they care more about the image of their country than the wellbeing of the people
        of Makoko. They have even gone so far that they have attempted to hide the slum on satellite imagery.</h2>

      <h2>In fact, an official population census of Makoko hasn't been conducted yet. An estimated 12,500
        homes have been built in Makoko, although each one houses 6-10 people.</h2>
