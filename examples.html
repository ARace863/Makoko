    <h1>Examples of Hope and Resilience</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>Other ways residents of Makoko have shown hope is that they have
        created healthcare relief systems, which were well needed. School
        children also had their eyes screened for free. This was because
        most of the children were not doing so well academically due to their poor vision.</h2>

      <h2>To bring it all together, I truly believe that Makoko is a slum of hope. They use
        the little resources that they have and attempt to make the best of their unfortunate situation.</h2>
