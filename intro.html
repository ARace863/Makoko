    <h1>Introduction to Makoko</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>I believe that Makoko is a slum of hope. This is because they have managed to
        build their own utilities such as schools, makeshift hospitals, shops, etc. to try and improve their quality of life.
        Not only that, they have built their own roads with the use of the disease-ridden water in which their slum is elevated from.</h2>

      <h2>The fact that they live in these abysmal and poor quality of life conditions but still
        desperately hope for better days creates a sense of unity throughout their
        respective communities. The people of Makoko has appointed its head chief,
        Raymond Adekule Olaiya.</h2>
